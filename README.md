# App-Development
repo for my Xamarin forms apps:

-> KFC is a project I made while training for Xamarin Forms. 
    This project is a personal one though I started and finished it during the internship period at Miele Tehnica Brasov with some help from my mentor there.

    I named it KFC because I wanted to make something food related like a burger app. The names I used in the app are for fun,
      nothing is meant to represent KFC or McDonalds in any way. I just used them because those were the first companies I could think of right off the bat.

-> My next project( in the works) -> I will be trying to make an app that helps me keep track of my bills/car stuff like inspections and whatnot
